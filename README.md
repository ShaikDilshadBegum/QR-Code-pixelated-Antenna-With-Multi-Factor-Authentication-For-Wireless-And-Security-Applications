QR-Code Pixelated Antenna with Multi-Factor Authentication for Wireless and Security Applications ðŸ“Œ  This project explores the integration of QR-code pixelated antennas with multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance wireless security and communication efficiency. 
ABSRACT:
This project introduces a QR-Code Pixelated Antenna combined with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to improve security and wireless communication. Traditional antennas are widely used, but this innovative design incorporates QR-code patterns, making antennas smaller, more efficient, and secure.
The antenna, built on a low-cost FR4 substrate, operates in the 8â€“9.6 GHz frequency range, ensuring strong signal transmission and broadband performance. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to scan a QR code and enter a password before accessing a network. Additionally, this system can be used in IoT devices, RFID tags, and secure communication networks.
With its compact size, enhanced security, and efficient data transmission, this QR-code pixelated antenna is a promising solution for modern wireless and security applications.

Existing System (Simplified Explanation)
1.	QR-Code Pixelated Antenna for Wireless Communication
o	These antennas are small, efficient, and easy to manufacture.
o	They are used in wireless sensor networks and IoT devices to improve communication.
o	Their compact design helps in saving space and reducing costs.
2.	QR-Code Pixelated Antenna for RFID Tags
o	RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags help in tracking objects and identifying products.
o	QR-code pixelated antennas make smaller, cheaper, and easy-to-read RFID tags.
o	These tags are useful in industries like retail, logistics, and security.

Disadvantages of the Existing System
ðŸš« Lack of Security â€“ Existing systems do not use authentication (anyone can access the wireless network or scan the RFID tag).
ðŸš« Limited Applications â€“ They are mainly used for communication and tracking, but not for security purposes.
ðŸš« Data Privacy Issues â€“ RFID tags can be easily cloned or hacked, leading to security risks.
ðŸš« No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) â€“ The current system does not verify users, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
ðŸš« Fixed Functionality â€“ They only act as antennas or RFID tags and do not have additional security features like encryption or user authentication.

Proposed System (Simplified Explanation)
1.	QR-Code Pixelated Antenna-Based MFA System for Wireless Networks
o	When a user wants to connect to a network, the antenna sends a unique QR code to their device.
o	The user must scan the QR code and enter a password to gain access.
o	This ensures only authorized users can connect, making the network more secure.
2.	QR-Code Pixelated Antenna-Based Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) for Security
o	PUF is a security feature that generates a unique, unchangeable identity for each device.
o	The QR-code pixelated antenna can act as a PUF, making devices tamper-proof and harder to clone.
o	This technology can be used to protect sensitive data, IoT devices, and electronic applications from hackers.
